# RyR_STORM2D
Blink and Cluster Analyzer for surface ryanodine receptors.

This program analyzes dSTORM blinks emitted by fluorophores attached to ryanodine
receptors on the surface of cardiomyocytes. The program uses Delaunay triangulation
to divide the blinks into clusters and then uses a two-step approach to define the clusters
and how they are grouped according to the neighbourhood limit. This is a measure
that represents the maximum distance over which Ca diffusion from one cluster can affect another.

Version 1.3.0 changes: Used CUD_Colour palette for the colour blind for certain visualizations.
Rewrote the documentation to reflect new palette. Numerous minor bug-fixes and code improvements.

To compile this program you need Qt5 (https://www.qt.io/ - Open Source ver 5.15.2)
and a C++ compiler that supports C++17. The program also requires access to
CGAL (https://www.cgal.org/ ver 5.5 or later) and libtiff ver 3 or later
(http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/) as well as OpenGL ver 4.3 or later. This program
can be compiled using Qt Creator in either Windows or Linux. In either case
the executable and the docs directory must be in the same directory for the help system
to work.

To directly install this program on a Windows computer, download RyR_STORM2D_Installer.exe.
This program works on both Windows 10 & 11. The documents, installed as
a subdirectory of where the program is installed, have a full description of its functions.
These documents can also be accessed from within the program using the F1 key.
