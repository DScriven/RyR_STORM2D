# RyR_STORM2D
Blink and Cluster Analyzer for surface ryanodine receptors.

This program analyzes dSTORM blinks emitted by fluorophores attached to ryanodine 
receptors on the surface of cardiomyocytes. The program uses Delaunay triangulation 
to divide the blinks into clusters according to the maximum distance that Ca2+ diffusion 
is assumed to excite other receptors, a parameter we called the neighbourhood limit. 

The program uses a two-step approach to define the clusters and how they are grouped 
according to the neighbourhood limit.

To compile this program you would need Qt5 (https://www.qt.io/ - Open Source ver 5.15.2) 
and a C++ compiler that supports C++17. The program also requires access to 
CGAL (https://www.cgal.org/  ver 5.5 or later) and libtiff ver 3 later 
(http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/) as well as OpenGL ver 4.3 or later. This program 
can be compiled using Qt Creator in either Windows or Linux.
