# RyR_STORM2D
Blink and Cluster Analyzer for surface ryanodine receptors.

This program analyzes dSTORM blinks emitted by fluorophores attached to ryanodine 
receptors on the surface of cardiomyocytes. The program uses Delaunay triangulation 
to divide the blinks into clusters according to the maximum distance that Ca2+ diffusion 
is assumed to excite other receptors, a parameter we called the neighbourhood limit. 

The program then uses a two-step approach to define the clusters and how they are grouped 
according to the neighbourhood limit, a measure that represents the maximum distance over 
which Ca diffusion from one cluster can affect another.

To compile this program you would need Qt5 (https://www.qt.io/ - Open Source ver 5.15.2) 
and a C++ compiler that supports C++17. The program also requires access to 
CGAL (https://www.cgal.org/  ver 5.5 or later) and libtiff ver 3 later 
(http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/) as well as OpenGL ver 4.3 or later. This program 
can be compiled using Qt Creator in either Windows or Linux. In either Windows or Linux
the executable and the docs directory must be in the same directory for the help system 
to work.
 
To directly install this program on a Windows computer download RyR_STORM2D_Installer.exe. 
This program works on both Windows 10 & 11. The documents, installed as 
a subdirectory of where the program is installed, have a full description of its functions.
These documents can also be accessed from within the program using the F1 key.
