<h2>Display Parameters</h2>
<p>All of these parameters can be changed to alter image that appears on the screen. They can be changed and then entered using the
"Modify" key and require minimal extra computation.</p>

<p></p>
<h3 id="boundaries">Cluster Boundaries</h3>
<center><img src="clusterboundaries.png"></center>
<p>The vermillion lines shows the boundaries of the base (i.e 30 nm) clusters. The image was generated with an 
<a href="computation.html#alpha">alpha</a> of 700.</p>Decreasing the alpha tightens the fit and follows the perimeter contour more tightly
as well causing some small holes to appear, while increasing the alpha has the opposite effect.</p> 
<h3 id="hull">Convex Hull</h3>
<center><img src="convexhull.png"></center>
<p>The convex hull (skyblue lines) outlines the minimum polygon that will envelop a cluster group. It is the best way to visually determine
the boundaries of the cluster groups as the <a href="computation.html#NL">neighbourhood limit (NL)</a> is increased.
The hulls represent a NL of 50 nm. </p>
<h3 id="ellipse">Minimum Ellipse</h3>
<center><img src="min_ellipse.png"></center>
<p>The minimum ellipse (bluish-green lines) allows an estimate in the changes in shape that occur on phosphorylation with isoproterenol. The 
minimum ellipse always contains the convex hull. The ellipses represent a NL of 50 nm.</p>
<h3 id="excluded">Excluded Blinks</h3>
<center><img src="excludedblinks.png"></center>
<p>The purple blinks represent those excluded during the fitting process as having <a href="computation.html#minblinks">too few blinks</a>
or being <a href="computation.html#minarea">too small</a> to be a tetramer. The actual size is smaller than shown here; the blink size has been 
increased to 3x3 pixels (<keybd> Alt + F10</keybd>) so that the points can be visualized.</p>
<h3 id="threshold">Log Threshold</h3>
<center><img src="logThreshInput.png"></center>
<p>To isolate regions of high blink density you can use the Log Threshold. All pixels below this threshold are in skyblue while those 
above are in vermillion - as in the image below. In this case the Log Threshold is -1.6.</p> 
<center><img src="logthreshold.png"></center>
<p>This threshold is image-wide so you may have to adjust it for certain clusters.</p>
<h3 id="CNum">Cluster Numbers</h3>
<center><img src="numbers.png"></center>
<p>Displays the numbers associated with each cluster. These numbers will change as the NL changes; those shown are for an NL of 50nm.</p>
