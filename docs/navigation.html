<h3>Navigating the blink image</h3>
<p>By default, the initial display is of the entire image, within the constraints of the screen size, so it is likely that the user 
will want to zoom in order inspect the clusters in more detail. If the image window is smaller than space available zooming in will 
increase the window size until it reaches the largest size possible after which the expansion is of the image alone. 
There are a number of actions that allow you to zoom in and out and move around the screen</p>
<ul>
<li>Centre and Zoom</li>
<p>To examine a cluster of interest, place the cursor over that cluster and double click the left mouse button. This will center the image on 
that cluster and zoom in. This action can be repeated if the zoom is insufficient.</p>
<li>Zoom</li>
<p>The plus key + zooms in on the blinks while the minus key zooms out. The position of the blink image with respect to the window boundaries
is maintained throughout the zooming process unless it is altered by "Centre and Zoom" (above) or "X-Y movement" (below).</p>
<li>X-Y movement</li>
<p>The blink image can move in any direction on the X-Y plane. On pressing the left mouse key the cursor changes to
a hand <img src="handcursor.png"> and the image can be dragged in any direction on the X-Y plane.</p>
</ul> 
<h3>Resetting the display</h3>
<p><b>F2</b> will reset the image to its original size, with zero offset and a zoom of 1.</p>
