<h2>Saving the blink image</h2>
<p>The image can be saved in two ways - either as a screenshot of the image or as a hi-res image 
whose size is virtually unlimited and with a resolution of up to 1000 dpi (dots per inch).</p>
<h3 id="screenshot">Saving a TIFF screenshot</h3>
<b>F12</b> saves a copy of the blink image as it currently appears. The resolution of the TIFF image (dpi) is the same as the 
screen dpi. The name of the image is fn_p[n].tiff where n is a number counting the saved images, so images do not overwrite each other. 
Thus RyRIso_5.3dSTM could generate the name RyRIso_5_p1.tiff.</p>  
<h3 id="hires">Saving a Hi-res Zoomed Image</h3>
<p>Screenshots, even on hi-res screens do not provide a publication quality resolution (300 dpi or more). Increasing the
dpi reduces the size of the image and so it might be necessary to magnify it. At screen resolution there are often multiple blinks 
in the same pixel so magnification may be required to clarify the image. The <b>Alt + F12</b> 
command brings up a menu that allows the user to set up the TIFF magnification and dpi.</p> 
<center><img src="tiffmagdpi.png"></center>
<p>Either pressing enter after entering a number or clicking on another box will calculate the size in inches or centimeters.</p>   
<p>A second way to use the menu is to zoom into an image until you get the level of detail you require and note that zoom value (IZ). 
Press <b>Alt + F12</b> and the menu will appear into which the user can enter IZ at the default dpi (300). The program will then use 
a frame buffer to generate a full image that is IZ times the initial image size. The naming is the same as for the screenshot.</p>
