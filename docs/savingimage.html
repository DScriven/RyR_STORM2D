<h2>Saving the blink image</h2>
<p>The image can be saved in two ways - either as a screenshot of the image or as a hi-res image 
whose size can be a multiple of of the maximum screen size.</p>
<h3>Saving a TIFF screenshot</h3>
<b>F12</b> saves a copy of the blink image as it currently appears. The resolution of the TIFF image (dpi) is the same as the 
screen dpi. The name of the image is fn_p[n].tiff where n is a number counting the saved images, so images do not overwrite each other. 
Thus RyRIso_5.3dSTM could generate the name RyRIso_5_p1.tiff.</p>  
<h3>Saving a Hi-res Zoomed Image</h3>
<p>Large images often appear on the screen greatly reduced in size with multiple blinks in the same pixel. The <b>Alt + F12</b> 
command allows the user to record a zoomed version of the full image at Hi-Res (300 dpi). The best way to use this is to zoom into 
an image until you get the level of detail you require and note that zoom value (IZ). Press <b>Alt + F12</b> and a box will appear 
into which the user can enter IZ. The program will then use a frame buffer to generate a full image that is IZ times the initial image size.    
The naming is the same as for the screenshot.</p>
<h3>Adding a scale bar</h3>
<p>To add a scale bar to the press <b>F5</b> which brings up a box allowing the user to enter the length of the scale bar in nanometers. 
Position the cursor to where the left bottom corner of the scale bar is to be placed and press the center mouse button. If the scale bar 
is in the wrong position pressing <b>F5</b> removes it and press <b>F5</b> again to restart the process.</p>
