<h2 id="SCD">Setting Computational Parameters</h2>

<center><img src="ComputationalParameters.png"></center>

<p>There are four values that must be set before the blink data set can be loaded 
(values in the image are defaults):</p>
<h3 id="NL">Neighbourhood limit</h3>
<p>The neighbourhood limit (NL) has a value between 30 and 300 nm. The first time an analysis is done 
of a data set, a 1st pass at 30 nm is done to calculate the base cluster areas 
followed by a second pass to calculate the size of the clusters at the NL chosen. All
subsequent invocations of the NL on the current data set will use the base and a 2nd pass. 
Cluster data is not saved between different limits, so to avoid repeat calculations it is recommended that
the <a href="clusterinfo.html#allcluster">"Save cluster data" box</a> be clicked.</p> 
<p>NOTE: The cluster blink data file saved with the <a href="clusterinfo.html#allclusterblinks">"Save cluster blinks"</a> box
is independent of the NL and need only be saved once per 3dSTM blink file.</p> 
<h3 id="minblink">Minimum Blinks per Tetramer</h3>
<p>This value is checked first after the clusters are calculated. If this value is not met no further analysis is
done and the points are added to the <a href="displayparameters.html#excluded" target="_blank">excluded blinks</a> list.</p>
<h3 id ="minarea">Minimum Tetramer Area</h3>
<p>This is the minimum area for a valid tetramer (default 600 nm<sup>2</sup>). As for the minimum blinks per tetramer, 
clusters that do not meet that criteria are added to the <a href="displayparameters.html#excluded" target="_blank">excluded blinks</a> list.
There are two other hidden criteria - for small clusters (&lt 2000 nm<sup>2</sup>) the 
<a href="displayparameters.html#ellipse" target="_blank">minimum ellipse</a>
must have a minor axis (&gt 24 nm) so as to exclude lines of blinks that may have an area above the minimum. The second hidden criterion checks whether the blinks to points
ratio is too high, so excluding fiduciary beads.</p>
<h3 id="alpha">Alpha value</h3>
<p>The alpha value (default 700) defines the way the <a href="displayparameters.html#boundaries" target="_blank">boundaries</a> of the 
base clusters are defined. Large holes will be detected and subtracted from the cluster area. Reducing the value to 400 (say) will improve  
the detection of small interior holes but the outer surface will get rougher. Reducing the alpha below 350 is not recommended. Increasing the alpha 
above 700 loosens the boundary fit.</p>     
<p>All of these values can be changed and the output altered with the "Modify" key.</p> 
<h3 id="Frame Numbers">Frame numbers</h3>
<image src="frameparameters.png">
<p>The frame numbers (i.e the number of images collected) can only be changed after the first run. It is limited by the values shown after the first
analysis. Changing these numbers means that the base clusters have to be recalculated, necessitating two passes. These base clusters remain true of
for whatever NLs are used and until the next change in the frame range.</p>
