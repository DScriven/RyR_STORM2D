<h2><b>Adding Tetramers to the Blink Image</b></h2>
<p>If a tetramer.dat file already exists it will be read in automatically immediately after the blink file.</p> 
<h2 id="addmodify">Adding, modifying and classifying tetramers</h2> 
<h3 id="add">Adding a tetramer</h3>
<p>Press the <b>a</b> key and left click the mouse in the approximate position
you want the tetramer to appear. The position of the tetramer can be moved
one pixel at a time using the four arrow keys on the keyboard. The rotation
is controlled by the mouse wheel. Once you are satisfied with the position
press the <b>s</b> key to save the tetramer position. Once this is done another tetramer can be added.</p>
<h3 id="modify">Modifying a tetramer</h3>
<p>First, identify the tetramer by pressing the <b>m</b> key and left click on the desired tetramer, 
which will change colour to black. To alter the position and 
orientation of the tetramer use the four arrow keys and the mouse wheel. Press the <b>s</b> key once finished</p>
<h3 id="delete">Delete a Tetramer</h3>
<p>To delete a tetramer, use the <b>m</b> key and left click to highlight it, then use the <b>d</b> key and 
it will be erased - Warning - this cannot be undone!</p>
<h3 id="addmodifykeys">Valid Add/Modify keys</h3>
<center><table style='width:80%'>
<tr><td>Esc</td><td>Immediately stop addition or modification</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arrow keys<br>(&larr;, &rarr;, &uarr; and &darr;)</td><td>Move the tetramer 1 pixel in that direction</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mouse wheel</td><td>Rotate tetramer</td></tr>
<tr><td>d</td><td>Delete the tetramer (after m)</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>Save tetramer after addition or modificatioon</td></tr>
</table></center>
<h3 id="classify">Classify a Tetramer</h3>
<p>To classify a tetramer, press the <b>c</b> key and left click on the desired tetramer to highlight it, 
then use one of the following keys to classify it.</p>
<center><table style='width:60%'>
<tr><td>Esc</td><td>Immediately stop classification</td></tr>
<tr><td>b</td><td>'both'</td></tr>
<tr><td>c</td><td>'checkerboard'</td></tr>
<tr><td>i</td><td>'isolated'</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>'side-by-side'</td></tr>
<tr><td>u</td><td>'unclassified'</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>Once the key is pressed the tetramer is classified</p>
<h3 id="analyzetet">Analysing the tetramer data</h3>
<p>The tetramers do not appear by default if loaded from a file - the <b>F7</b> key is a toggle that will cause the added or stored tetramers 
to appear or disappear.</p>
<p>The NND values can be displayed at any time by pressing <b>n</b> on the keyboard, but a pixel size of ~1nm is needed to clearly 
see the values. The NND value will only appear if there are two or more tetramers in a cluster. The blink image can be hidden with 
the <b>F6</b> after which the tetramers will be shown in outline on a black background with the NNDs if  <b>n</b> 
has been pressed. Both <b>n</b> and <b>F6</b> are toggles whose effects can be reversed by pressing them again. (The NNDs will no longer appear, the 
blinks will reappear, and the tetramers will be represented by squares).</p>
<p>Although the default tetramer width is 27 nm it is possible to change that width by pressing the <b>F8</b> key</p>
<p>The tetramer and NND data is saved in two files: fn_tetramer.dat and fn_nnd.dat (where fn is the 3dSTM filename). The first file stores
the (x,y) position of each tetramer, its orientation and cluster number while the second is a list of the calculated NND files. These files 
can be saved manually at any time by using the F9 key, although finishing an analysis pressing
any one of the following keys or icons: <b>Esc</b>, <b>Close</b> or the file browser button will automatically calculate the NNDs and save the 
two files.</p>
