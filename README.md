# RyR_STORM2D
Blink and Cluster Analyzer for surface ryanodine receptors.

This program analyzes dSTORM blinks emitted by fluorophores attached to ryanodine 
receptors on the surface of cardiomyocytes. The program uses Delaunay triangulation 
to divide the blinks into clusters according to the maximum distance that Ca2+ diffusion 
can affect other receptors, a parameter called the neighbourhood limit. 

The program uses a two-step approach to define the clusters and how they are grouped 
according to the neighbourhood limit.

To install this program on your Windows computer download RyR_STORM2DLoader.exe (not 
tested on Windows 11) and run program as Administrator. The documents, installed as 
a subdirectory of where the program is installed, have a full description of its functions.
These documents can also be accessed from the program using the F1 key.
